        <div>If a number is divisible by 2, the least significant digit (rightmost)
            <br>will be an even number (2, 4, 6, 8 or 0)
            <br>37598 is divisible by 2
            <br>286409 is not divisible by 2
            <br>
            <br>If all the digits in a number add up to another number that is divisible
            <br>by 3, the original number is divisible by 3
            <br>9036 is divisible by 3
            <br>The digits in 528 add up to 5 + 2 + 8 = 15 which is divisible by 3,
            <br>so 528 is also divisible by 3
            <br>The digits in 479 add up to 4 + 7 + 9 = 20, which is not evenly
            <br>divisible by 3, so 479 is not divisible by 3
            <br>
            <br>If a number is divisible by 5, the least significant digit will
            <br>be a 0 or a 5
            <br>
            <br>If a number is divisible by 11, the sum of the odd digits minus
            <br> the sum of the even digits will be 0 or a multiple of 11
            <br>The odd digits in 1067 add up to 7 + 0 = 7; the even digits 
            <br>of 1067 add up to 6 + 1 = 7. Odd digits - even digits = 7 - 7 = 0,
            <br>so 1067 is divisible by 11
            <br>The odd digits of 8093624 add up to 4 + 6 + 9 + 8 = 27,
            <br>the even digits of 8093624 add up to 2 + 3 + 0 = 5.
            <br>Odd digits - even digits = 27 - 5 = 22 which is a multiple of 11,
            <br>so 8093624 is divisible by 11
            <br>Odd digits minus even digits of 1331 equal 0, so 1331 is divisible by 11
            <br>
            <br>Guess if you want to
            <br>
            <br>Best to always divide out prime factors in the same order, starting
            <br>with smaller numbers. A possible exception is dividing out 11s
            <br>before 7s, because it's usually easier to spot if a number is 
            <br>divisible by 11 than by 7
            <br> </div>
